MD Version:
**LLM Usage**: All work was done in VSCode with [GitHub Copilot integration](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/overview). The integration "provides code suggestions, explanations, and automated implementations based on natural language prompts and existing code context," and also offers autonomous coding and an in-IDE chat interface that is able to interact with the current codebase. Only the Copilot provided automatic inline suggestions for both LaTex and Python in `.tex` and `.ipynb` Jupyter notebook files respectively were taken into account / used.
